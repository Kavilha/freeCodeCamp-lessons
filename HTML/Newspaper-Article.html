        <p class="sub-headline">One Small Paw for Cat, One Giant Leap for Felinekind</p>
        <p class="author">By Jane Doe</p>
        <p class="text">On a starry night, a cat named Whiskers—known for his insatiable curiosity—accidentally discovered a tiny rocket hidden in the attic of his owner, Dr. Lila, a brilliant scientist. Without a second thought, Whiskers pressed a big red button with his paw—and blasted off into space!</p>
        <p class="text">Upon landing on the Moon, he stumbled upon a crew of alien mice attempting to steal all the lunar cheese to dominate the galaxy. With a strategic meow, Whiskers activated the rocket’s gravity system, sucking the invaders into a laser trap. The Moon was saved!</p>
        <p class="text">Back on Earth, Whiskers was hailed as a hero. Dr. Lila, laughing through tears, gifted him an astronaut helmet and a lifetime supply of tuna. And so, the bravest cat in the universe proved that even the smallest can have cosmic adventures.</p>
